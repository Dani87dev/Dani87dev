## Hi, I'm Dani 👋

Junior Backend Developer | Java | Spring Boot | SQL | Git

I hold a Higher Vocational Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (FP DAM) and I am currently strengthening my backend skills through a Java Backend Bootcamp at IT Academy.

At the same time, I am starting a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at the Universidad Internacional de Valencia (VIU), where I am building a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals.

My current focus is on learning how to design clean and maintainable backend applications using Java and Spring Boot, working with relational databases, and applying good development practices such as version control and structured problem solving.

I am motivated to keep growing as a backend developer and to contribute to development teams where I can learn, improve, and add value from day one.
