👋 Hi, I'm Dani  
💻 Junior Backend Developer · ☕ Java · 🌱 Spring Boot · 🗄️ SQL · 🔧 Git

I hold a Higher Vocational Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (FP DAM) and I am currently strengthening my backend skills through a Java Backend Bootcamp.

At the same time, I am starting a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering, where I am building a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals.

🚀 What I'm focusing on  
🏗️ Building backend applications with Java and Spring Boot.  
📚 Learning how things work under the hood, not just how to use them.  
🌱 Applying clean code principles and good development practices.  
🎯 Goal: write clear, maintainable backend code that solves real problems.
